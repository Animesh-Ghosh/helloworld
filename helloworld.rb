# Goal: An active global group of rubyists working together

# Usage: ruby helloworld.rb
# Dependency: install ruby via https://www.ruby-lang.org

# Process:
#  * use github web editor to edit: https://github.com/alterisian/helloworld/blob/main/helloworld.rb
#    (which will fork the github repo: https://github.com/alterisian/helloworld to your user's account)
#  * add your line see bottom of helloworld.rb
#  * create a commit "adding my name" and select the 'Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request' option
#  * observe Github Action run the script: ruby helloworld.rb

# WHY: Inspired by Bob Allen who introduced the world to
# global liquid mobs, lets try and create a global mob for ruby
# Reference: https://twitter.com/alterisian/status/1610941873589477377

# History: January. 6 people contributed bv adding their say_hello line to gitlab.
# TODO: February. 4 more contributed to github. We lost CI though?
# TODO: March. Maybe we can refactor so the output is split with everyone
# listed, but the next 3 west of a handle are first? To be more tweetable.
#  - Consider introducing the hometown as an additional argument?

# Join the Málaga mob listed on: https://mobusoperandi.com/mobs/malaga.html
